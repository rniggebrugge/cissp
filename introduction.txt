CISSP Mindset

- your role is a risk advisor, think like a manager. You are not a decision maker, nor the one fixing the problems. You advice
- who is responsible? Ultimately senior management. 
- how much security is enough? just enough is enough. Balance cost and value of the assets you secure and the damage these assets are at risk at.
