CHAPTER 1 - Security and Risk Management

video 1:

All decisions start with Risk Management and everything we do secures the continuity of the business

CIA - confidentiality, integrity, availability
IAAA - Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Auditing/Accountability

video 2:

Core security: CIA

CONFEDENTIALITY: 
encrypting (minimum keylenth)

Overt: Cryptography and masking (like showing * instead of password letters)
Covert: steganography (message inside another message) - embedding, how to address this avoiding it from happening

Three states of data: at rest, in process, in transit

In rest		: always encrypt
In process	: must be decrypted when working on data. Not much you can do. Clean desk policy, avoid shoulder surfing, lock system
In transit	: use SSL, TLS, ipSec to protect data in transit. Do not allow FTP or other clear text transit models

INTEGRITY

System integrity addresses the correct functioning of a system.
Data integrity provides assurance that the data has not been manipulated or modified.

Protect against code injection.
Ensuring data has not been altered in transition. Use CRCs, checksums, message digests, hashes

AVAILABILITY

Metrics used: 
	MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime), 
	RTO (Recovery Time Objective) - how quickly must I recover my data,
	RPO (Reovery Point Objective) - how much recent data could I stand to lose
	SLAs: specifify minimum availability requirement
	MTBF: mean time between failure
	MTTR: mean time to repair

AUTHENTICITY
allow anonymous access (public)
basic authenticity: user supplied password, transmitted in clear text
digest: challenge/response
certificates, tokens, smart cards

This should all be specified in our program

AUTHORIZATION

Confirms an authenticated entity has privileges and permissions necessary. Always work from principle of least-privileges. Give absolute minimum permissions to do the job.

CRUD: creat, read, update, delete

Access Control Models (ACM)
	- DAC	: discretionaty access model
	- MAC	: mandatory access control
	- RBAC	: role based access control
	- RuBac	: role based access control (like firewalls)

ACCOUNTABILITY

Tracing an action to a subject - also known as auditing

Must include:
	- identity of subject
	- action performed
	- object which action was performed on
	- timestamp

Audit logs should not overwrite previous events, they should append
Audit logs must be retained for one year

Above identification, authentication, authorization and auditing are core security requirements + Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
