CHAPTER 1 - Security and Risk Management

****************** VIDEO - PART 1:

All decisions start with Risk Management and everything we do secures the continuity of the business

~~ CIA - confidentiality, integrity, availability
~~ IAAA - Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Auditing/Accountability

****************** VIDEO - PART 2:

Core security: CIA

CONFEDENTIALITY: 
encrypting (minimum keylenth)

Overt: Cryptography and masking (like showing * instead of password letters)
Covert: steganography (message inside another message) - embedding, how to address this avoiding it from happening

Three states of data: at rest, in process, in transit

In rest		: always encrypt
In process	: must be decrypted when working on data. Not much you can do. Clean desk policy, avoid shoulder surfing, lock system
In transit	: use SSL, TLS, ipSec to protect data in transit. Do not allow FTP or other clear text transit models

INTEGRITY

System integrity addresses the correct functioning of a system.
Data integrity provides assurance that the data has not been manipulated or modified.

Protect against code injection.
Ensuring data has not been altered in transition. Use CRCs, checksums, message digests, hashes

AVAILABILITY

Metrics used: 
~~	MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime), 
~~	RTO (Recovery Time Objective) - how quickly must I recover my data,
~~	RPO (Reovery Point Objective) - how much recent data could I stand to lose
~~	SLAs: specifify minimum availability requirement
~~	MTBF: mean time between failure
~~	MTTR: mean time to repair

AUTHENTICITY
allow anonymous access (public)
basic authenticity: user supplied password, transmitted in clear text
digest: challenge/response
certificates, tokens, smart cards

This should all be specified in our program

AUTHORIZATION

Confirms an authenticated entity has privileges and permissions necessary. Always work from principle of least-privileges. Give absolute minimum permissions to do the job.

~~ CRUD: creat, read, update, delete

Access Control Models (ACM)
~~	- DAC	: discretionaty access model
~~	- MAC	: mandatory access control
~~	- RBAC	: role based access control
~~	- RuBac	: role based access control (like firewalls)

ACCOUNTABILITY

Tracing an action to a subject - also known as auditing

Must include:
	- identity of subject
	- action performed
	- object which action was performed on
	- timestamp

Audit logs should not overwrite previous events, they should append
Audit logs must be retained for one year

Above identification, authentication, authorization and auditing are core security requirements + Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.

 
****************** VIDEO - PART 3:

Tenets of secure architecture and design. These tenets are always valid/applicable:

- How much security is enough: just enough, balance cost and benefit, driven by risk analysis
- Defense in depth: no one mechanism will secure all. Layers of protection
- Fail-safe: system should fail in such a manner to protect itself. Example: Windows blue screen, nothing can be done afterwards
- Economy of mechanism: keep it simple and straight forward, easier to secure (KISS)
- Completeness of design: ensure to protect security through the entire life-cycle of the software. In any assistance there is an equality of protection
- Least common mechanism: profit from what's out there, don't reinvent the wheel
- Open Design: make it known, we prefer open architecture to allow for peer review
- Consider the weakest link: in organisation it is the users. not all malicious.
- Redundancy: avoid single point of failure. System that can withstand when one element fails
- Psychological Acceptability: if a system has become so in-accessible by security measures, users will find ways to by-pass it (or not use at all!)
  ==security is there to support the business function. If users have a difficult time, you are not meeting the goals
- Separation of Duties (SOD): no one individual has too much power within system or environment. Roles with permissions
- Mandatory Vacations
- Job rotation : not one person do all work on system, rotate so more eyes see. 
- Least Privileges: give just enough rights to do your job    (ACTION ALLOWED)
- Need to know: give access rights to what you need to know.  (DATA ACCESSIBLE)
- Dual control: some activities are so potentially harmfull that we do not allow one person to do these. For example: recover private key.


********************** VIDEO - PART 4:

Risk management ~= Security Management

Risk Management steps:
	identify
	assess
	treat
	monitor
	
Risk definitions:
	- asset: provides value to the organisation, tangible or intangible. Risk management should start with valuating the assets
	- risk: likelyhood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability in an asset
	- threat: has to potential to harm an asset
	- vulnerability: a weakness, a lack of safeguard
	- exploit: instance of compromise
	- controls: proactive mechanisms to secure vulnerabilities
		safeguards: proactive - DETERS or PREVENTS
		countermeasures: reactive mechanism - DETECTS and/or CORRECTS

Types of risk:
	- total risk: amount of risk without implementing mitigation.
	- secondary risk: risk that comes as a result of another risk response
	- residual risk: amount of risk left after a risk response

Fallback plan: plan B
Workaround: unplanned response (for unidentified risk or when other responses do not work)
		

****************** VIDEO - PART 5:

Risk assessment steps: 
	- risk assessment: identify assets, threads, vulnerabilities
	- risk analysis: value of potential risk
	- risk mitigation: responding to risk. Reduce residual risk to levels acceptable by senior management
	- risk monitoring: risk is forever!

ASSESSMENT:
- identify and valuate assets
- identify threads and vulnerabilities
- Methodologies:
	- OCTAVE
	- FRAP (Facilitated Risk Analysis Process)
	- NIST 800-30: risk management guide for Information Technology systems !! 9 step process:
		1. system characterization
		2. threat identification
		3. vulnerability identification
		4. control analysis
		5. likelyhood determination
		6. impact analysis
		7. risk determination
		8. control recommendations
		9. results documentation


****************** VIDEO - PART 6:

Risk Analysis

Qualitative: subjective analysis to help prioritize probability and impact of risk events
	May use Delphi Technique

Quantitave: 
	- providind a dollar value to a particular event
	- much more sophisticated in nature, a quantitative analysis is much more difficult and requires special skill set
	- business decisions are made on a quantatitive analysis
	- can't exist on its own, quantatitive analysis depends on qualitative anaylsis
	- more experience required
	- involves calculations to determine dollar value associated with each risk event
	- business decisions are made on this type of analysis
	- necessary for cost/benefit analysis
	
~~ AV, asset value, dollar value to organization
~~ EF, exposure factor, percentage lost expected as result of manifistation of particular risk event
~~ SLE, single loss expectancy: AV*EF
~~ ARO, annual rate of occurence: how often the threat is expected to materialize
~~ ALE, annual loss expectanct: AV*EF*ARO
~~ TCO, total cost of ownership, total cost of implementing a safe-guard (initial fixed cost plus yearly fees)
~~ ROI, return of investment, money saved by implementing a safeguard, also referred to as value of safeguard/control

ROI = ALE_before - ALE_after - TCO

Understanding the appropriate amount of security, need to know the potential for loss


****************** VIDEO - PART 7:

RISK MITIGATION

Quantitative analysis leads to proper risk mitigation strategy. Possible actions:
	- reduce: lessening probability or impact
	- accept: potential for loss is less than cost of mitigation -> do nothing
	- transfer: (insurance, SLA), share risk with someone else. Prob or impact not reduced, but the cost shared
	- avoidance: change activity (bringing prob or impact to zero)
	- rejection: also do nothing, but just ignore, pretending no risk. Not allowed, not proper risk management. 

Aim of risk management is to bring the amount of (residual) risk to level acceptable by senior management.
Cost/benefit analysis will help decide the best mitigation strategy

More risk calculations (conceptual!):
	threats * vulnerability * asset value = total risk
	total risk * controls gap = residual risk (control gap is portion of risk that cannot be mitigated)


****************** VIDEO - PART 8:

GOVERNANCE VS. MANAGEMENT

Governance set the course for the ship, management conducts the steering.
Or: governance sets out what we're going to accomplish, management says how.

Governance: ensures stakeholder needs, conditions and options are evaluated to determine:
	- balanced agreed-upon enterprise objectives
	- direction through prioritization and decision making
	- monitoring performance and compliance against agreed-upon direction and objective

Management: plans, builds, runs and monitors activities in alignment with direction set by governance body to achieve the enterprise objectives

Governance is responsible for risk appetite
Management is responsible for risk tolerance, translates appetite in something quantitative


****************** VIDEO - PART 9:

FRAMEWORDS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT'S ROLE

Governance is responsibility of the board under direction chair person.
Set the tone of the organisation and determining framework under which the organization will operate.

The framework provide structure/foundation. Every organization will implement differently.

Most testable: ISO 27000 series (27001, 27002).
- ISO 17799, 27000
- BS7799
- COBIT, COSO
- OCTAVE
- ITIL

COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and related Technologies) ---\
COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations)    --------------------------- both focus on goals of security
															COBIT goals for IT
															COSO  goals for organization

ITIL: Information Technology Infrastructure Library is de facto standard for best practices for IT Service management

5 service management publications:
	- strategy
	- design
	- transition
	- operations
	- continual improvement

OCTAVE:	Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation
	- self directed risk evaluation. People within organisation direct risk analysis
	- suite of tools, techniques and methods for risk-based information security strategy assessment and planning
		1. identify risks
		2. identify vulnerabilities
		3. risk analysis and mitigation

BS7799-1 and BS 7799-2 absorbed by ISO 17799
Renamed to ISO 27002 to fit ISO numbering standard

Direction on how to plan, force, setup, manage, implement and improve an Information Security Management System (ISMS)

ISO 27001 gives guidance on the ISMS: establishment, implementation, control and improvements of the ISMS
	Follows the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act)
ISO 27002 replaced ISO 17799: provides practical advice for how to implement security controls. Uses 10 domains to
	address ISMS.
ISO 27704: provides metrics for measuring success of ISMS
ISO 27005: standards based approach to risk management
ISO 27799: directive on protecting personal health information

PDCA:	
	PLAN 	: establish ISMS
	DO 		: implement and operate ISMS
	CHECK 	: monitor and review ISMS
	ACT 	: maintain and improve ISMS

Approach to security mamagement either Top-Down or Bottom-Up
What you want: Top-Down -> management 'gets it', security practices are directed and supported by senior manamgement
Bottom Up -> it department tries to implement security, senior management sees it as necessary evil

Senior Management Role: CEO (chief executive officer), CSO, CIO, etc.
	- ultimately responsible for security
	- development and support policies
	- allocation of resources
	- decision based on risk
	- priorization of business processes

LIABILITIES

- Legal liability important consideration for risk assessment and analysis
- Addresses whether company is responsible for specific actions or inaction
- Who is responsible for security: Senior Management!!
- Are we liable in instance of loss?
	- due diligence: continuously monitor organization's practices to ensure meeting/exceeding secuirity requirements
	- due care: ensuring best practices implemented and followed. !! follow up due diligence with action
				diligence: intelligence
				care: action
	- prudent man rule: acting responsibly and cautiously
	- best practices: organizations are aligned with favoured practices within industry
	- culpable negligence: recklessly acting without reasonable caution and putting other persons at risk


****************** VIDEO - PART 10:

POLICIES PROCEDURES

Several policy documents.

1/ Organizational Security Policy 

For entire policy, does not go into detail, doesn't single out specific persons or assets.

- aka Program Policy
- mandatory!
- high level statement from management
- supports strategic goals of an organization
- explain any legislation or industry specific drivers
- assigns responsibility
- integrated into all business functions
- enforcement and accountability

2/ Issue and system specific policy

- issue specific policy (also called functional implementation policy) would include company's stance on various employee issues (AUP, email, privacy, ..)
- system specific policy is geared towards use of network and system resources. approved software lists, use of firewalls, IDS, scanners, webserver, ...

Concerning issue specific policy: inform employee about what to expect, where is there an expectation of privacy, where not. Where is accepted use policy, etc. It is easier to deter 'bad behaviour' than to detect it! With these policies you do not try to catch the bad guys, rather keep the good guys honest!

3/ Other types

	- regulatory 	: be in compliance
	- advisory		: advice
	- informative	: just so you know... fyi

Laws, regulations and best practices
		\-- Program Policy (=Organizational Policy)
				\-- Functional (issue and system specific) policies
					\-- [standards] , [procedures] , [baselines] , [guidelines]

- Standards:
	+ mandatory
	+ specifics, definitions
	+ reinforces policy and provides direction
	+ can be internal/external

- Procedure:
	+ mandatory
	+ step by step directives on how to accomplish end-result
	+ detail the "how to" of meeting the policy, standards and guidelines

- Guidelines
	+ NOT mandatory
	+ suggestive
	+ recommended actions
	+ best practices

- Baselines
	+ mandatory
	+ minimum acceptable security configuration for a system or process
	+ purpose of security classification is to determine and assign the necessary
	  baseline configuration to protect the data
	+ example: when receiving new server: patch them (latest service packs), reset default configuration settings, 
	  remove unneeded services, remove default admin account, etc. This is meeting to baselines.

Baseline can also mean: snapshot of normally behaving systems (CPU usage, network traffic, Memory usage, etc), against
which current behaviour can be compared. Little differences from the baseline should be investigated


****************** VIDEO - PART 11:

KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER

Awareness, training, education. People are often the weakest link in securing information.
The goal of knowledge transfer is to modify employee behaviour ->  thereby raising overall security of organization

What is the purpose of.... should always come to changing behaviour, raise security

Being aware of the rules

	Security awareness traing:
		- employees cannot and will not follow the directives and procedures if not known
		- employees must know expectations and ramifications if not met
		- employee recognition award program
		- part of due care
		- this is an ADMINISTRATIVE control


****************** VIDEO - PART 12:

TYPES OF LAW

read ISC2 code of ethics. Will be some questions on it: 
		https://www.isc2.org/uploadedfiles/(isc)2_public_content/code_of_ethics/isc2-code-of-ethics.pdf

- Criminal law
- Civil law
- Regulatory (also administrative law)
- Intellectual Property

1/ Criminal Law
	- beyond reasonable doubt: can be difficult to meet burden of proof in computer-related crimes, jurors not 
	  understanding....
	- penalties: financial, jail-time, death
		+ felonies: more serious of two. Penalty results in incarceration of 1 year+
		+ misdemeanors: normally less serious. Fines are jail-time 1 year-
	- goal of criminal penalties
		+ punishment
		+ deterrence

2/ Civil (Tort) Law
	- preponderance of evidence (=majority of evidence) . Lower burden of prove
	- damages
		+ compensatory (harm, investigative costs)
		+ punitive
		+ statutory: amount stipulated in law rather than calculated based on harm. Often statutory damages
		  are awarded for acts in which it is difficult to determine value of harm to victim
	- liability, due care, due diligence, prudent person rule are pertinent to civil law, as well as administrative law

3/ Administrative (Regulatory) Law
	- defines standards of performance and regulates conduct for specific industries
		+ banking (Basel II)
		+ energy (EPAct) of 2005
		+ Health Care (HIPAA)
	- Burden of proof is "more likely than not"
	- penalties consist of financiel or imprisonment

4/ Intellectual Property   [04:28....]

	- intellectual property law
		+ protecting products of the mind
		+ company must take steps to protect resources covered by these laws, otherwise the laws do NOT protect
	- main int. organization UN: WIPO, World Intellectual Property Organization
	- most prevalent violations: Licensing, Plagiarism, Piracy, Corporate espionage

	Types:

	- Trade Secret
		+ must provide competitve value
		+ must be reasonable protected from unauthorized disclosure
		+ proprietary to company and important for survival
		+ genuine and not obvious
	
	- Copyright
		+ for authors
		+ protection for lifetime of author + 70 years (or 75 years after date of copyright for corporations)
		+ work does NOT need to be registered or published to be protected
		+ protects expression of ideas rather than the ideas themselves
		+ author to control how work is distributed, reproduced, used
		+ protects the expression of the resources instead of the resource itself
		Two limitations/exceptions:
		+ First sale [you can resell a (CD, DVD, Book, etc) bought, but cannot reproduce]
		+ Fair Use [you can make a copy of something you own for own use, limits within reason, judges discression]
	
	- Trademark
		+ protect word, name, symbol, sound, shape, color or combination used to identify products to distinguish from others
		+ protect from stealing another company's "look and feel"
		+ corporate brands, operating system logos, ...
		+ Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act protects trademarks internationally

	- Patent
		+ for inventors
		+ originally valid for 17yrs, not 20 YEARS
		+ protection for those with legal ownership of an invention
		+ invention must be novel and non-obvious
		+ owner has exclusive control of invention for 20 years
			(example cryptographical algorithm)
		+ strongest form of protection
		+ published to stimulate other inventions
		+ PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) adopted by 130 countries, provided international protection 
		+ no organization enforces patents, up to owners to purse the patents through legal system

	Attacks on IP:
		- piracy
		- copyright infringement
		- couterfeiting
		- cybersqatting: purchase a URL you think someone else might need...
		- typosquatting: purchase a URL that is close (typo away) from known URL
