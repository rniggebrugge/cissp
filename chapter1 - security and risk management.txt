CHAPTER 1 - Security and Risk Management

****************** VIDEO - PART 1:

All decisions start with Risk Management and everything we do secures the continuity of the business

~~ CIA - confidentiality, integrity, availability
~~ IAAA - Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Auditing/Accountability

****************** VIDEO - PART 2:

Core security: CIA

CONFEDENTIALITY: 
encrypting (minimum keylenth)

Overt: Cryptography and masking (like showing * instead of password letters)
Covert: steganography (message inside another message) - embedding, how to address this avoiding it from happening

Three states of data: at rest, in process, in transit

In rest		: always encrypt
In process	: must be decrypted when working on data. Not much you can do. Clean desk policy, avoid shoulder surfing, lock system
In transit	: use SSL, TLS, ipSec to protect data in transit. Do not allow FTP or other clear text transit models

INTEGRITY

System integrity addresses the correct functioning of a system.
Data integrity provides assurance that the data has not been manipulated or modified.

Protect against code injection.
Ensuring data has not been altered in transition. Use CRCs, checksums, message digests, hashes

AVAILABILITY

Metrics used: 
~~	MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime), 
~~	RTO (Recovery Time Objective) - how quickly must I recover my data,
~~	RPO (Reovery Point Objective) - how much recent data could I stand to lose
~~	SLAs: specifify minimum availability requirement
~~	MTBF: mean time between failure
~~	MTTR: mean time to repair

AUTHENTICITY
allow anonymous access (public)
basic authenticity: user supplied password, transmitted in clear text
digest: challenge/response
certificates, tokens, smart cards

This should all be specified in our program

AUTHORIZATION

Confirms an authenticated entity has privileges and permissions necessary. Always work from principle of least-privileges. Give absolute minimum permissions to do the job.

~~ CRUD: creat, read, update, delete

Access Control Models (ACM)
~~	- DAC	: discretionaty access model
~~	- MAC	: mandatory access control
~~	- RBAC	: role based access control
~~	- RuBac	: role based access control (like firewalls)

ACCOUNTABILITY

Tracing an action to a subject - also known as auditing

Must include:
	- identity of subject
	- action performed
	- object which action was performed on
	- timestamp

Audit logs should not overwrite previous events, they should append
Audit logs must be retained for one year

Above identification, authentication, authorization and auditing are core security requirements + Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.

 
****************** VIDEO - PART 3:

Tenets of secure architecture and design. These tenets are always valid/applicable:

- How much security is enough: just enough, balance cost and benefit, driven by risk analysis
- Defense in depth: no one mechanism will secure all. Layers of protection
- Fail-safe: system should fail in such a manner to protect itself. Example: Windows blue screen, nothing can be done afterwards
- Economy of mechanism: keep it simple and straight forward, easier to secure (KISS)
- Completeness of design: ensure to protect security through the entire life-cycle of the software. In any assistance there is an equality of protection
- Least common mechanism: profit from what's out there, don't reinvent the wheel
- Open Design: make it known, we prefer open architecture to allow for peer review
- Consider the weakest link: in organisation it is the users. not all malicious.
- Redundancy: avoid single point of failure. System that can withstand when one element fails
- Psychological Acceptability: if a system has become so in-accessible by security measures, users will find ways to by-pass it (or not use at all!)
  ==security is there to support the business function. If users have a difficult time, you are not meeting the goals
- Separation of Duties (SOD): no one individual has too much power within system or environment. Roles with permissions
- Mandatory Vacations
- Job rotation : not one person do all work on system, rotate so more eyes see. 
- Least Privileges: give just enough rights to do your job    (ACTION ALLOWED)
- Need to know: give access rights to what you need to know.  (DATA ACCESSIBLE)
- Dual control: some activities are so potentially harmfull that we do not allow one person to do these. For example: recover private key.


********************** VIDEO - PART 4:

Risk management ~= Security Management

Risk Management steps:
	identify
	assess
	treat
	monitor
	
Risk definitions:
	- asset: provides value to the organisation, tangible or intangible. Risk management should start with valuating the assets
	- risk: likelyhood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability in an asset
	- threat: has to potential to harm an asset
	- vulnerability: a weakness, a lack of safeguard
	- exploit: instance of compromise
	- controls: proactive mechanisms to secure vulnerabilities
		safeguards: proactive - DETERS or PREVENTS
		countermeasures: reactive mechanism - DETECTS and/or CORRECTS

Types of risk:
	- total risk: amount of risk without implementing mitigation.
	- secondary risk: risk that comes as a result of another risk response
	- residual risk: amount of risk left after a risk response

Fallback plan: plan B
Workaround: unplanned response (for unidentified risk or when other responses do not work)
